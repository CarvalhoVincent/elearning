## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid



### What I learned

I learned how to use the <picture> element and how to change an image depend on the screen width.
Also learned some skills with the media queries but need to train further with it.


### Continued development

Again, I need to improve my responsive skills, this one is better than the last but not really perfect with any width size. I discover the mobile-first workflow too late in this project and I'll try it on the next.
I think my CSS file is a bit too long and may be smaller with optimization.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.w3schools.com] - Use it for some searches and reminders.
- [https://stackoverflow.com/ ] - Use for some information about the background image.
